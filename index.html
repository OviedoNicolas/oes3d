                            3D scanning is a technology that captures the shape, size, and appearance of real-world objects or environments to create a three-dimensional representation. It involves using devices, such as lasers to collect data points on the surface of an object. These data points are then processed to generate a 3D digital model.

                            With OES3D, you're getting a personalized experience that will transform your project into a work of art. As reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product, system, or technology to understand its structure, functionality, and design principles, it also involves dissecting and studying the components of a given object or system to uncover how it works and how it was developed. In the context of OES3D's, reverse engineering refers to our expertise in extracting detailed information from physical objects or digital models to facilitate the recreation or improvement of those items.
